# Problems #20 - 29

* Problem #20 (Google)
    * Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node.
      The lists are non-cyclical.
      * For example, given `A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10` and `B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10`, return the node
        with value 8.
      * In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.
    * Do this in `O(M + N)` time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
* Problem #21 (Snapchat) *DONE*
    * Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping),
      find the minimum number of rooms required.
    * For example, given `[(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]`, you should return 2.
