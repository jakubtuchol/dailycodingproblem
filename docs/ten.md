# Problems #10 - 19

* Problem #10 (Apple)
    * Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.
* Problem #11 (Twitter) *DONE*
    * Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a dictionary of all possible query strings, return all strings in the dictionary that have s as a prefix.
* Problem #12 (Amazon) *DONE*
    * There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2
      steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique
      ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
    * For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
        * `1, 1, 1, 1`
        * `2, 1, 1`
        * `1, 2, 1`
        * `1, 1, 2`
        * `2, 2`
    * What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could
      climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5},
      you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.
